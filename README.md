# UNO-Text-Fighter
A text fighter made with Python. I coded this with the intent of learning object-oriented programming.

The gameplay is inspired by the classic UNO card game, where cards are played based on colour and number.
However, in this text fighter, instead of discarding all your cards to win, your objective is to defeat your opponent.
Each card played will deal damage to your opponent equal to the number on the card.
There are also special cards such as the x2 card, doubling the damage of the next damage dealing card,
the +2 card which lets you immediately draw 2 cards, 
and the wild card which lets you play any card on top of it, without any colour or number restriction.

There are also some additional rules such as:
When you use up your entire hand, you will draw 7 new cards on your next turn.
If you choose to end your turn prematurely, you will draw 2 new cards on your next turn.
